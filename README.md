Personal Notes
==============

These contain personal notes of everything and anything i study or come across while working.  

__Stuffs that it might contain__  
Programming language  
Tools or frameworks  
keywords acting as pointer and reminder of topics learned  
Only pointers, never too detailed notes describing each step  
What i need to do  
Books and weblinks  
Rest you will always have to Google  

__how its done__  
Taking notes is simple - categorize your notes in files and folders  
Add and move them as you go on  
Use Sublime Text 2 while taking or navigating through notes  
As its Goto Anything feature helps navigate to any point of notes almost instantly  
Sublime Text 3's indesing feature will help better  

Maybe Gist is a better way to do this  
But by this i can completely controll how i want it to be organized and very quick to start  

PS: You may follow and suggest through issues but dont send pull request as its just a personal note.
