Numerical Calculation Methods
=============================

Fixed point method
==================
f(x) = x (generally under certain tolerance)  
__Babylonian method__ - calculating square root  
__Newton's method__ for finding roots of a real valued functions  
__Halley's method__ - similar to Newton's method but better  
__Runge-Kutta method__ - solutions of ordinary differential equations  
__Picard-Lindeelof theorem__  
__goal seeking__  
__Banach fixed point theorem__
