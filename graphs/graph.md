Graph
=====

Directed  
UnDirected  
MultiGraph  
BiPartite Graph  

Deterministic Graph Generation
------------------------------
Grid/Mesh  
Domino Graph - domino pizza logo  
Fully connected  
Ring  
Star  
Tree  
Ravasz-Barabasi - deterministic scale free graph  

__scale free__ - whose degree distribution follow power law ie rich gets richer  
two models for scale free - Preferential attachment and fitness model  

Random Graph Generation
-----------------------
Erdos-Renyi Graph  
Random graph with exact degree seq  
Barabasi-Albert - preferential attachment, power law degree distribution  
scale free Geometric Preferential attachment - Flexman  
small world graph - Watts-Strogatz model  
random scale free graph with Copying model  
R-MAT Generator: A recursive model for Graph Mining  

Search Algos
------------
BFS  
DFS
